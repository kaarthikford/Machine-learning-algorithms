# Machine-learning-algorithms
This is a repository of my learning in R program on machine learning. 
Naive Bayes algorithm is a classifier used to identify the dependent or target variable 
with the help of independent variables. I have attached a file which hold two examples
of using Naive Bayes which I learned through edureka and youtube. This algorithm is 
quiet helpful when we need to take a call based on unrelated independent variables 
exist in the dataset.

This code requires Rstudio for execution
